    <p>It’s a new virus, meaning no one has immunity, and there is no vaccine.The WHO has labeled COVID-19 as a pandemic,<b>but that doesn’t mean you need to freak out. </b>80% of people infected experience mild, cold and flu-like symptoms. Also, according to the CDC, COVID-19 is thought to be a droplet disease, meaning it spreads from person to person via respiratory droplets, like when someone coughs or sneezes.Constructive precautions to take include staying away from large crowds.Luckily, we live in a tech age that allows us to connect with friends, even while stuck at home by ourselves.

    <h2 class="w3-border-bottom w3-padding-16">Story of Coronavirus (COVID-19)</h2>
    <p>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.
      <br>
    Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment.  Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.
    <br>
    The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes and how it spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face. 
    <br>
    The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes, so it’s important that you also practice respiratory etiquette (for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow).
    <br>
    At this time, there are no specific vaccines or treatments for COVID-19. However, there are many ongoing clinical trials evaluating potential treatments. WHO will continue to provide updated information as soon as clinical findings become available.

    <h2 class="w3-border-bottom w3-padding-16">Facts: Cleaning with Disinfectant</h2>
    <p>The authors also found that these coronaviruses can be effectively wiped away by household disinfectants. 
<br>
For example, disinfectants with 62-71% ethanol, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide or 0.1% sodium hypochlorite (bleach) can "efficiently" inactivate coronaviruses within a minute, according to the study. "We expect a similar effect against the 2019-nCoV," the researchers wrote, referring to the new coronavirus. But even though the new coronavirus is a similar strain to the SARS coronavirus, it's not clear if it will behave the same.
<br>
Diluted household bleach solutions, alcohol solutions containing at least 70% alcohol and most EPA-registered common household disinfectants should be effective at disinfecting surfaces against the coronavirus, according to the CDC. The bleach solution can be prepared by mixing 5 tablespoons (one-third cup) of bleach per gallon of water or 4 teaspoons of bleach per quart of water, the CDC wrote in a set of recommendations.

    <h2 class="w3-border-bottom w3-padding-16">Facts: How Coronavirus spreads</h2>
    <p>
Coronavirus disease spreads primarily through contact with an infected person when they cough or sneeze. It also spreads when a person touches a surface or object that has the virus on it, then touches their eyes, nose, or mouth.

    <h2 class="w3-border-bottom w3-padding-16">Facts: How long Coronavirus stays on surface</h2>
    <p>We can pick up the Covid-19 by touching surfaces contaminated with the new coronavirus, but it is only just becoming clear how long the virus can survive outside the human body.
<br>
A new analysis found that the virus can remain viable in the air for up to 3 hours, on copper for up to 4 hours, on cardboard up to 24 hours and on plastic and stainless steel up to 72 hours. This study was originally published in the preprint database medRxiv on March 11,  and now a revised version was published March 17 in The New England Journal of Medicine.
